# Project Name

A home to store all of my weird code projects. 

Hello there. I’m Cynthia, a front-end web developer focused on building and maintaining 
scalable, responsive, and accessible web experiences using some of the following technologies and frameworks: 

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS3 
- WordPress/PHP development
- JavaScript
- React JS 

I help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) build, optimize, and maintain 
digital platforms so that it functions and looks great on multiple devices. 

I love helping people connect with their tribe awesome! It's corny, but true. 
I enjoy reading, cooking, and learning how to draw things when I’m not [writing](https://heycynwrites.com) or coding ’till 
the wee hours of the [morning in pajamas](https://heycynwritescodeinpjs.com).


Want to collaborate on a project? Wonderful! 
Let’s [chat](mailto:workwithme@heycynwrites.com)about how 
I can help you take the next step toward your project's goals.

This project is designed and built with love :heart:, lots of coffee :coffee:, and an awesome playlist :musical_note:. Copyright &copy; 2023-2025 [@heycynwrites](https://heycynwrites.com).
